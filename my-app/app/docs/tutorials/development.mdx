<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Install Intelli on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g intelli
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add intelli
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Go to the docs are located (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
intelli dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Intelli uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Intelli runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
intelli dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Intelli in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Intelli Versions

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Intelli. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g intelli@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade intelli
```

</CodeGroup>
